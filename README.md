📊 End-to-End Data Analysis Project
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to delivering actionable business insights. It covers:

Loading datasets into Jupyter Notebook

Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Cleaning and preprocessing data

Writing and executing SQL queries in PostgreSQL to meet business requirements

Building interactive Power BI dashboards

Documenting findings in a professional report

Presenting insights with a Gamma-powered presentation

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Jupyter Notebook) → Data loading, EDA, cleaning

PostgreSQL → SQL queries, business logic implementation

Power BI → Interactive dashboard creation

Gamma → Automated presentation design

Libraries Used: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

📂 Project Workflow
1. Data Loading
Import raw dataset (.csv or .xlsx) into Jupyter Notebook.

Validate schema, check column types, and ensure proper encoding.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, variance).

Distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, and outlier detection.

Identify missing values and anomalies.
3. Data Cleaning
Handle missing values (imputation, removal).

Normalize/standardize numerical features.

Encode categorical variables.

Validate cleaned dataset with visualizations.

4. SQL Queries in PostgreSQL
Load cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL.

Write queries to answer business requirements, e.g.:

Customer segmentation

Sales trends

Product performance

Optimize queries for efficiency.
5. Business Insights
Translate SQL outputs into KPIs and actionable insights.

Align queries with stakeholder requirements.

6. Power BI Dashboard
Connect PostgreSQL to Power BI.

Create interactive dashboards:

Customer segmentation visuals

Sales trend analysis

Regional performance breakdown

Apply filters, slicers, and drill-downs for dynamic exploration.

7. Reporting
Document methodology, findings, and recommendations.

Include visuals from Power BI and Jupyter Notebook.

Provide a clear narrative for decision-makers.
8. Presentation (Gamma)
Convert report into a Gamma presentation.

Highlight key insights with visuals and storytelling.

Ensure slides are concise, professional, and business-oriented.
